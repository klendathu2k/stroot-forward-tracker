StgUtil imports the "utiltiy" classes from Daniel's forward tracker.
The following changes have been made to make it compile...

1) XmlConfig

   Removed the string ts( size_t i, int len = -1 ) method, as 
   has the same signature as ts (unsigned int i, int len = -1 ).

2) Removed dependency on Tracker/loguru.h, use instead XmlConfig/loguru.h

3) Removed the dependency between KiTrack and the concrete FwdHit class.

   This removes the histogramming functionality for the time being.

   Strongly recommend that the hits (as IHit*) be passed to the 
   histogramming facility, and that the required logic be evaluated
   external to these utility classes.
